Contributers: Mark Sturtz & Geraldine Jennifer Dessa.

The purpose of this High Distinction task is to build a prototype web/mobile application for our local City Councils (Greater Shepparton City Council & Melbourne City Council) to classify waste, dependant on local council recycling policies and procedures.

The prototype was built and tested utilising *Gradio* as the application base and *Keras* for model development & deployment.
